5️⃣ Process Management & Monitoring
Task:
Start a background process (ping google.com > ping_test.log &).
Use ps, top, and htop to monitor it.
Kill the process and verify it's gone.

1. Start the background process
You execute the command to start the background process:

ping google.com > ping_test.log &
The output is typically something like this:
[1] 12345
Here, 12345 is the process ID (PID) of the background ping process. This confirms the command is running in the background.

2. Monitor the process using ps
You check running processes with the ps command:
ps aux | grep ping

Expected output:

user     12345  0.0  0.1  123456  2340 pts/0    S    14:25   0:00 ping google.com
user     12346  0.0  0.0   6200   872 pts/0    S+   14:25   0:00 grep --color=auto ping
The line starting with user and PID 12345 is the ping process.

The second line is the grep command you just executed to filter for ping, and can be ignored.

3. Monitor the process using top
You open the top command:

top
You’ll see a live, updating list of processes. Look for the ping process in the list, which will show something like this:

output:
PID USER      PR  NI    VIRT    RES    SHR S  %CPU %MEM     TIME+ COMMAND
12345 user      20   0   123456   2340   1230 S   0.0  0.1   0:00.12 ping
The ping process will appear, and you can monitor its CPU and memory usage in real-time.

4. Monitor the process using htop
If you have htop installed, you can run:

htop
In htop, you’ll see a colorful, interactive list of processes. You should see something like this:

PID   USER      TIME  COMMAND
12345 user      0.0s  ping google.com
You can navigate through htop to find the ping process easily.

5. Kill the process
Now that you know the PID (let’s assume it's 12345), you can kill the process:

kill 12345
Or forcefully:

kill -9 12345
After running this command, there will be no output if the process is successfully killed. However, you can verify if it's gone using ps, top, or htop.

6. Verify the process is gone
After killing the process, you can run the ps command again:

ps aux | grep ping
Expected output:

user     12346  0.0  0.0   6200   872 pts/0    S+   14:25   0:00 grep --color=auto ping
Here, only the grep command shows up (the ping process is no longer listed).

Alternatively, you can run:

top
Or:

htop
The ping process will no longer appear in the list.

Summary of the steps and outputs:
Start the background process: ping google.com > ping_test.log & → [1] 12345

Monitor with ps: ps aux | grep ping → Shows the ping process with PID 12345.

Monitor with top: top → Lists ping running with CPU usage.

Monitor with htop: htop → Lists ping running interactively.

Kill the process: kill 12345 → No output if killed successfully.

Verify the process is gone: ps aux | grep ping → No ping process listed anymore.
