Task:
Create /devops_workspace and a file project_notes.txt.
Set permissions:
Owner can edit, group can read, others have no access.
Use ls -l to verify permissions.

1.Create the /devops_workspace directory: You can use the mkdir command to create the directory.
mkdir /devops_workspace

2.Create the project_notes.txt file: Inside the /devops_workspace directory, create the file project_notes.txt.
touch /devops_workspace/project_notes.txt

3.Set permissions: You want the following permissions:

Owner: Read, write, and execute (can edit)

Group: Read only

Others: No access

4.To achieve this, use the chmod command to set the permissions.
chmod 740 /devops_workspace/project_notes.txt
Hereâ€™s how the permissions break down:

7 (owner): read (4) + write (2) + execute (1) = 7

4 (group): read (4)

0 (others): no access

5.Verify the permissions: Use the ls -l command to verify the permissions of the file.
ls -l /devops_workspace/project_notes.txt

The output should look something like this:

-rwxr----- 1 owner group 0 Mar 28 10:00 /devops_workspace/project_notes.txt
In this output:

The first rwx indicates the owner has read, write, and execute permissions.

The next r-- indicates the group has read-only permissions.

The final --- means others have no access.
