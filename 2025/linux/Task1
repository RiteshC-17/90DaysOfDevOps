1️⃣ User & Group Management
Learn about Linux users, groups, and permissions (/etc/passwd, /etc/group).
Task:
Create a user devops_user and add them to a group devops_team.
Set a password and grant sudo access.
Restrict SSH login for certain users in /etc/ssh/sshd_config.

In Linux, managing users, groups, and permissions is crucial for maintaining security and control. Let's break down how to manage users, groups, set permissions, and restrict SSH access.

1️⃣ Creating a User and Adding to a Group
1.Create a user: Use the useradd command to create a new user.
sudo useradd devops_user
Explanation: Creates a user named devops_user.

2.Create a group: Use the groupadd command to create a new group.
sudo groupadd devops_team

3.Add user to group: Use usermod to add the user to the group.
sudo usermod -aG devops_team devops_user
Explanation: Adds devops_user to the devops_team group.

2️⃣ Set a Password for the User
Set password: Use passwd to set a password for the user.
sudo passwd devops_user
Explanation: Prompts you to enter a new password for devops_user.

3️⃣ Grant Sudo Access to the User
1.Edit sudoers file: To give devops_user sudo privileges, add the user to the sudoers file.
sudo visudo

2.Add the following line (under the User privilege section):
devops_user  ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
Explanation: Grants devops_user full sudo privileges without a password prompt.

4️⃣ Restrict SSH Login for Certain Users
Edit the SSH configuration: To restrict SSH login for certain users, modify /etc/ssh/sshd_config.

1.Open the SSH config file:
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config

2.Add the following line to deny SSH login for specific users:
DenyUsers user1 user2
Explanation: Replace user1 and user2 with the usernames you want to restrict from SSH login.

After making changes, restart SSH service:
sudo systemctl restart sshd

Configuration Files
/etc/passwd: Contains user account information.

/etc/group: Contains group information.

/etc/ssh/sshd_config: Configures SSH settings, including user restrictions.

Summary
Create a User: sudo useradd devops_user

Create a Group: sudo groupadd devops_team

Add User to Group: sudo usermod -aG devops_team devops_user

Set Password: sudo passwd devops_user

Grant Sudo Access: Edit /etc/sudoers via sudo visudo

Restrict SSH Access: Modify /etc/ssh/sshd_config and add DenyUsers.
