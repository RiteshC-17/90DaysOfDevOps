Task:
Download the log file from the repository.
Extract insights using commands:
Use grep to find all occurrences of the word "error".
Use awk to extract timestamps and log levels.
Use sed to replace all IP addresses with [REDACTED] for security.
Bonus: Find the most frequent log entry using awk or sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -10.

# Step 1: Download the log file
wget <log_file_url>

# Step 2: Find all occurrences of the word "error"
grep -i "error" logfile.log

# Step 3: Extract timestamps and log levels
awk '{print $1, $2, $3}' logfile.log

# Step 4: Replace IP addresses with [REDACTED]
sed -E 's/([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}|([a-f0-9]{1,4}:){7}[a-f0-9]{1,4}/[REDACTED]/g' logfile.log

# Bonus: Find the most frequent log entry
awk '{print $0}' logfile.log | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -10
