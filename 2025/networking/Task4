Practice essential networking commands like:
ping (check connectivity)
traceroute / tracert (trace packet routes)
netstat (network statistics)
curl (make HTTP requests)
dig / nslookup (DNS lookup)
Task: Create a cheat sheet or short guide explaining the purpose and usage of each command.

1. Ping (Check Connectivity)
Purpose: Checks if a device (e.g., server, router) is reachable over the network.

Usage:
ping [hostname or IP address]

Example:
ping google.com
Explanation: Sends ICMP Echo Request packets to the target and waits for a response. Useful for testing network connection and latency.

2. Traceroute / Tracert (Trace Packet Routes)
Purpose: Traces the path packets take to reach a destination and shows where delays occur.

Usage:

Linux/macOS: traceroute [hostname or IP address]

Windows: tracert [hostname or IP address]

Example:
traceroute google.com
tracert google.com
Explanation: Displays the route (hops) and the time it takes to reach each router along the way.

3. Netstat (Network Statistics)
Purpose: Displays network connections, routing tables, interface statistics, and other network-related information.

Usage:
netstat [options]

Common Options:

-a: Displays all active connections and listening ports.

-t: Shows TCP connections.

-u: Shows UDP connections.

-l: Displays only listening ports.

Example:
netstat -tuln
Explanation: Shows the list of listening ports and established connections, useful for troubleshooting network issues.

4. Curl (Make HTTP Requests)
Purpose: Transfers data from or to a server using various protocols (mostly HTTP/HTTPS).

Usage:
curl [options] [URL]
Common Options:

-I: Fetches the HTTP headers only.

-X: Specifies the HTTP request method (e.g., GET, POST).

-L: Follows redirects.

Example:
curl https://example.com
curl -I https://example.com
Explanation: Useful for testing web servers, retrieving HTTP headers, or sending POST requests.

5. Dig / Nslookup (DNS Lookup)
Purpose: Queries DNS to obtain domain name information such as IP addresses and record types.

Usage:

Linux/macOS: dig [domain]

Windows: nslookup [domain]

Example:
dig google.com
nslookup google.com
Explanation: Provides detailed DNS query information. Dig is more advanced, while Nslookup is simpler and available on all platforms.

Summary
Ping: Check connectivity and response time.

Traceroute/Tracert: Trace the path of packets and identify bottlenecks.

Netstat: Display active network connections and ports.

Curl: Send HTTP requests to web servers for testing.

Dig/Nslookup: Perform DNS queries to get domain-related information.

Use these commands to diagnose and troubleshoot network issues effectively!
